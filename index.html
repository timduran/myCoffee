    <h1> Why Caramel Frappe is the best Coffee!</h1>
    <p>While the Starbucks Frappuccino has more of a coffee flavor, the Frappe has a very strong cream taste. Both flavors were
    delicious, although I felt they were a bit too sweet. The Caramel one had a flavor that reminded me of coffee ice cream.
    ... The McDonald's Frappe are a good addition to the McCafe menu.
